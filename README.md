# Game-Of-Codes
A project in System Verilog given by course instructor in CS223 Fall 2017 Course, Bilkent University

CS223 Laboratory Project  - Game of Codes
____________
In the course project of this semester, all students implement the same project topic. You need to use both the FPGA BASYS-3 board and the Beti board together. BASYS-3 board should be assembled on the Beti board properly using a connector board. You need to refer to documents on Unilica for more information. For the first time, you can also ask lab supervisor to give you a guide on this to prevent damaging your BASYS-3 board. Two pictures from project setup is inside the project files. 
Project description: A sequence of random codes is generated by the hardware inside the FPGA. The stepper motor module on the Beti board plays this sequence by applying unique movements for each code. The player person watches the movements of stepper motor and enters the corresponding ASCII character sequence using the 4x4 keypad on the Beti board. For each correct/incorrect character, the player earns/loses 1 point. Total points are displayed on the 7-segment display module on the BASYS-3 board (use only one of digits).
