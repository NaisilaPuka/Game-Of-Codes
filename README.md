# Game-Of-Codes
A project in System Verilog given by course instructor in CS223 Fall 2017 Course, Bilkent University <br />
PROJECT WAS DONE WITH VIVADO 2015.2. Project setup in image1.jpg. <br />
Vivado Design Suite is a software suite produced by Xilinx for synthesis and analysis of HDL designs, superseding Xilinx ISE with additional features for system on a chip development and high-level synthesis. <br />

CS223 Laboratory Project  - Game of Codes
____________
I used both the FPGA BASYS-3 board and the Beti board together. BASYS-3 board should be assembled on the Beti board properly using a connector board.
## Project description: 
A sequence of random codes is generated by the hardware inside the FPGA. The stepper motor module on the Beti board plays this sequence by applying unique movements for each code. The player person watches the movements of stepper motor and enters the corresponding ASCII character sequence using the 4x4 keypad on the Beti board. For each correct/incorrect character, the player earns/loses 1 point. Total points are displayed on the 7-segment display module on the BASYS-3 board (use only one of digits).
